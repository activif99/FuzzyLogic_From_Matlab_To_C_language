# Overview

This project implements a Fuzzy Logic-Based Energy Management System for electric vehicles (EVs). It focuses on processing vehicle data using fuzzy logic to compute an energy management coefficient.

The project involves migrating fuzzy logic algorithms from MATLAB to C, enabling better performance and compatibility with embedded systems. The dataset, provided as input, contains parameters such as velocity, slope, state of charge (SoC), and temperature, which are used to calculate the coefficients.

# Key Features 


- Fuzzy Logic Implementation: Migrated from MATLAB to C for optimized performance.
- High Performance: Real-time processing of vehicle data for embedded applications.
- Dataset-Driven: Uses real-world vehicle data for practical and accurate results.
- Output Consistency: Ensures that results from the C implementation match those from MATLAB.
