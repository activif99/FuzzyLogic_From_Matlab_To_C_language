# Overview

This project implements a Fuzzy Logic-Based Energy Management System for electric vehicles (EVs). It focuses on processing vehicle data using fuzzy logic to compute an energy management coefficient.

The project involves migrating fuzzy logic algorithms from MATLAB to C, enabling better performance and compatibility with embedded systems. The dataset, provided as input, contains parameters such as velocity, slope, state of charge (SoC), and temperature, which are used to calculate the coefficients.

# Key Features 

- Fuzzy Logic Implementation: Migrated from MATLAB to C for optimized performance.
- High Performance: Real-time processing of vehicle data for embedded applications.
- Dataset-Driven: Uses real-world vehicle data for practical and accurate results.
- Output Consistency: Ensures that results from the C implementation match those from MATLAB.

# Implementation Details

## 1. Dataset Processing
The dataset, formatted as a CSV file, contains fields such as Time, Velocity, Slope, Temperature, and State of Charge (SoC). The program reads and processes these fields to compute fuzzy logic coefficients for each time interval.

## 2. Fuzzy Logic in C

### Membership Functions
The project implements trapezoidal, Gaussian, and Pi-shaped membership functions in C, which were originally defined in MATLAB. These functions represent input variables such as temperature, slope, velocity, and SoC.

### Fuzzy Rules
A comprehensive set of fuzzy rules defines the relationships between input parameters and the output coefficient. These rules are implemented directly in C using logical conditions.

### Defuzzification
The weighted average method is used to compute the final coefficient. It aggregates the output of all fuzzy rules into a single crisp value, representing the energy management coefficient.

# Results
## Functional Validation
The coefficients generated by the C implementation are validated against MATLAB results, ensuring consistency and correctness.

## Performance Comparison
A performance benchmark highlights significant improvements when using C:

| Criterion | MATLAB |  C  | Improvement |
|-----------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Time for 1st Row | 17.85 ms |  2 ms  | ≈ 88% |
| Total Execution Time (27766 Rows) | 34.3 sec |  922 ms  | ≈ 97% |

# Setup

first you need to change the path to the dataset **TripB10_B11_fuzzy_throttle_hvac_1.csv** and the path to the results **results.csv** on the source code to their paths on your device:  
```
const char *filePathData = "C:/Users/univ/Desktop/stadiz/(PROJET)PFS_FuzzyLogic/TripB10_B11_fuzzy_throttle_hvac_1.csv";
const char *filePathRsults = "C:/Users/univ/Desktop/stadiz/(PROJET)PFS_FuzzyLogic/results.csv";
    
```

run the source code
